# DNASearch
Application which simulates a DNA genome search and compares performance of two string searching algorithms: Booy-Moore and Rabin Karp.

# Future Enhancments
- Current hash search algorithm for the Rabin Karp method could be optimized further
- Add more string searching algorithms to compare

# Learning Outcomes
- How to measure perfomance with the VS performance profiler tool
- Understanding of how string searching algorthims function
- How to properly structer a multi-class program for OOP 
- How to apply Big O Notation to algorithms
